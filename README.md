# Groceries-Sales-Prediction-App
This is a project to create an app using streamlit to make groceries sales predictions. 
Predicting sales is an important aspect of business operations. Sales prediction is necessary for effective decision-making in the management of a business, particularly in terms of demand and supply planning.  The project produced a sales prediction app using Streamlit to Corporation Favorita automate their sales predictions.
Streamlit is an open-source framework that helps developers create apps quickly and easily. It is intuitive and interactive and can be used to create a wide range of applications, including data analysis, machine learning models, and data visualization. This project makes use of Streamlit to build a sales prediction app.
The application predicts sales based on input features such as the date, the product family, the city, the cluster, the store number, the oil price, the holiday type, and whether the product is on promotion. The application takes these input features and returns a predicted sales figure.
On the interface, a form for collecting input data from the user is seen. Streamlit's columns layout displays the input fields in three columns. Input features such as date, the product family, the city, the cluster, the store number, the oil price, the holiday type, and whether the product is on promotion were provided to enable accurate predictions to be made.
